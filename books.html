            The only book that I read the most is the "Holy Bible". This book changed the way I think and the way I live. Or, basically, it changed my life.<br>
            This book is very important to me, and this is when I realized that the word of God is powerful.<br>

            Sometimes I read fiction books and manga. I started liking these kinds of books when I first read "Hell University," which I borrowed.<br>
            And it hit me, so I started reading more genre and bought some in the book store.
