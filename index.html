            I like listening to music because it helps me relax and become productive when I'm studying.<br>
            Sometimes I play music for myself to be able to sleep. <br>

            I spend <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> of my time watching movies and series. Especially when I have free time or am on vacation.<br>
            I also prefer watching alone with my snacks.<br>

            I have many old books in the house, and most of them are about animals, stories, documentaries, etc.<br>
            That's why it became my hobby to haggle for stuff and read books.<br>

            I use social media to communicate with my friends online.
            I sometimes study with strangers to be more productive and improve my focus.<br>

            When I really have nothing to do and there's a book and a pen near me.<br>
            I usually write something from my mind and apply some creative words to it.<br>
            I don't do this often because my handwriting is bad.<br>
            <br>
            The things I like writing about are song lyrics, my day, or just random things that I can see.<br>
